# MINI PROJECT
# Real-Time Speech Emotion Detection
A machine learning project for real-time emotion detection using the RAVDESS dataset and Mel spectrograms.

## Overview
This project aims to predict emotions from speech using deep learning. It processes real-time audio input, extracts features using Mel spectrograms, and classifies emotions.

## Features
Real-time emotion detection from speech
Supports both live recording and file upload
Uses Mel spectrograms as input features
Trained on the RAVDESS dataset
##Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Librosa for audio processing
- Matplotlib for visualization
## Dataset
The project utilizes the RAVDESS Emotional Speech Audio dataset, which contains emotional speech samples.
